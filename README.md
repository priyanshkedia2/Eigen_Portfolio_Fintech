# Eigen_Portfolio_Fintech
This project is dedicated to implementing Eigen portfolios, a sophisticated approach to portfolio optimization based on eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. By leveraging Python libraries like NumPy and Scikit-learn, it applies modern portfolio theory (MPT) to construct portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk. The provided Jupyter notebook guides users through data analysis, eigen portfolio calculation, and visualization steps. Users can easily clone the repository, install dependencies listed in the requirements, and follow along with the notebook to explore and create their own eigen portfolios. This project not only provides a practical implementation of eigen portfolios but also serves as an educational resource for understanding advanced portfolio optimization techniques.
